# The phases in `repo-blueprint.yaml` must be the phases the bootstrap runs,
# placing what they are meant to place, saying what they are, and naming only
# what the engine can resolve.
#
# The partition below is the bootstrap's order, written down a second time on
# purpose. It is the one-landing shape (cirrus-baseline v22): `01-product`
# places EVERY module and is the one phase that deploys; `02-docs` places
# nothing. The order that used to need separate landings — the R2 bucket
# before the Worker that binds it — is carried by the plan instead, and this
# file checks the edges that carry it: every component that reads a wiring
# document waits, on a merge to main, for the infra component that publishes
# it. Each reader resolves its document in the convergence from the place
# every later run looks, so a green convergence says the document is there —
# no separate check. A module that drifts into another phase, or an edge that
# goes missing, fails at landing time, live, with nothing in this repository
# having looked wrong.
#
# And the shape that keeps a bootstrap fast (orun >= v2.88.0): the run-level
# task set-up runs in the background, each phase finds its task just before
# its landing, each landing checks its commit here (`checks: local`), and the
# convergence watch reads every few seconds.
#
# Adapted from sourceplane/cirrus-baseline's testing/phases.test.sh: the
# narration rules and the hook-only rule are Cirrus's, unchanged.
